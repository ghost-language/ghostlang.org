## Methods

### `os.args()`

Returns a list of command line arguments passed to a Ghost script. The first element `[0]` is the script name.

```typescript
os.args()
```

### `os.clock()`

Returns the number of nanoseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC.

<callout>
January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC is referred to as the Unix epoch. Early Unix engineers picked that date arbitrarily because they needed to set a uniform date for the start of time, and New Year's Day, 1970, seemed most convenient.
</callout>

```typescript
os.clock()

// expected value: 1643344902998773000
```

### `os.exit()`

Causes the current program to exit with the given status code and optional message. Conventionally, code zero indicates success, non-zero an error. The program terminates immediately.

For portability, the status code should be in the range `[0, 125]`.

```typescript
os.exit(0, "Process completed successfully")

// expected outout: Process completed successfully
```

## Properties

### `os.name`

Returns the name of the current operating system:
- `darwin` (macos)
- `linux`
- `windows`

```typescript
os.name

// expected value: darwin
```
