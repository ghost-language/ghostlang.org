## What is Lumen?

Lumen is a lightweight 2D game engine for Ghost. It's a standalone application that allows you to create and publish your own games.

## Building Lumen
Lumen is currently under development and is not feature complete, however, you can experiment with it by downloading and building the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/ghost-language/lumen).

If you're on a Unix or Mac machine, you can easily download the source code and build Lumen directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghost-language/lumen
cd lumen
make
```

This downloads and builds the latest version of Lumen found on GitHub. You will immediately have the latest version of Lumen ready to go!
